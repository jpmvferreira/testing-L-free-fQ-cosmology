## Repository outline
- `/analyzed`: Includes processed data, mainly plots.
- `/aux`: Auxiliary scripts to aid in analysis or in automation.
. `/config`: The configuration files used for the command line interface of the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) programming language, [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan.html).
- `/data`: The real and mock datasets with the values of the shift parameters.
- `/jobs`: Bash scripts to run the MCMC's locally or via the [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) workload manager.
- `/model`: The cosmological models to be constrained using [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan.html).
- `/output`: The output of the MCMC's (chains, plots, diagnostics, and backup of the data+model+config used).
- `/venv`: The virtual environment used to carry out our analysis.

## Virtual environment
To replicate the virtual environment start by cloning this repository locally using `git` to a specific folder (using "shift-params" as an example):
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/jpmvferreira/testing-L-free-fQ-cosmology shift-params
```

Use `conda` (or any other compatible package manager) to create a new virtual environment from the file `shift-params/venv/environment.yml`, which the default name is "msc" and is enconded on the file:
```console
$ conda env create -f fqgw/venv/environment.yml
```

Activate the newly created environment:
```console
$ conda activate msc
```

Use `pip` to install all Python packages listed in `fqgw/venv/environment.yml`:
```console
$ pip install -r shift-params/venv/requirements.txt
```
