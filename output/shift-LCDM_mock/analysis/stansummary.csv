# Inference for Stan model: shift_LCDM_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2500,2500,2500,2500); warmup=(2500,2500,2500,2500); thin=(1,1,1,1); 20000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (46, 44, 50, 47) seconds, 3.1 minutes total
# Sampling took (46, 48, 45, 45) seconds, 3.1 minutes total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
